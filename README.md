# Alpha Factor Research for Stochastic Processes

## Overview

This codebase is designed for researchers investigating **novel formulaic alpha factors** to outperform **stochastic processes** in the context of mathematical finance, algorithmic trading, or quantitative research. The aim is to model, test, and evaluate alpha factors that could provide an edge in predicting or mitigating the randomness of financial time series and stochastic environments.

### What are Alpha Factors?

Alpha factors are mathematical expressions or models used in quantitative finance to predict the future performance of assets. These are often used in portfolio construction, stock ranking, and risk management. In the context of stochastic processes, alpha factors aim to extract signals that can provide a predictive advantage over the random fluctuations in asset prices or other measurable phenomena.
