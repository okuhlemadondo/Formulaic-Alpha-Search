# Alpha Factor Research for Stochastic Processes

## Overview

This codebase is designed for researchers investigating **novel formulaic alpha factors** to outperform **stochastic processes** in the context of mathematical finance, algorithmic trading, or quantitative research. The aim is to model, test, and evaluate alpha factors that could provide an edge in predicting or mitigating the randomness of financial time series and stochastic environments.

### What are Alpha Factors?

Alpha factors are mathematical expressions or models used in quantitative finance to predict the future performance of assets. These are often used in portfolio construction, stock ranking, and risk management. In the context of stochastic processes, alpha factors aim to extract signals that can provide a predictive advantage over the random fluctuations in asset prices or other measurable phenomena.

## Key Modules

### Alpha Factor Generator

The `alpha_generator` module is the core of the codebase, responsible for defining, simulating, and generating new formulaic alpha factors. This is where researchers can define mathematical models to be tested against stochastic processes.

#### Key Functions:
- `generate_alpha(factor_params)`  
  Generates an alpha factor based on the input parameters.

- `custom_alpha(expression)`  
  Allows researchers to define custom alpha factor formulas.

### Stochastic Process Models

The `stochastic_models` module contains implementations of various stochastic processes, such as:

- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**
- **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process**
- **Mean-Reverting Models**
- **Jump Diffusion Models**

These models simulate random processes for backtesting alpha factors.

#### Key Functions:
- `simulate_gbm(params, steps)`  
  Simulates a Geometric Brownian Motion process.

- `simulate_ou(params, steps)`  
  Simulates an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

### Backtesting and Evaluation

The `evaluation` module includes functions to backtest alpha factors against historical data or simulated stochastic models. This module helps evaluate how effective a given alpha factor is in predicting future states of the stochastic processes.

#### Key Functions:
- `backtest_alpha(alpha_factor, data)`  
  Runs a backtest simulation using the generated alpha factor and returns performance metrics.

- `evaluate_performance(results)`  
  Analyzes the backtest results and generates key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Usage

### Defining Alpha Factors

To define an alpha factor, you can either use predefined templates or define custom formulas. Below is an example of defining a custom alpha factor:

```python
from src.alpha_generator import custom_alpha

# Define a custom formula for the alpha factor
alpha_factor = custom_alpha("log(price) * volume / sqrt(volatility)")

# Parameters can also be passed dynamically
params = {
    'price': data['price'],
    'volume': data['volume'],
    'volatility': data['volatility']
}
```

### Running Simulations

To test the alpha factor against a stochastic process, you can run a simulation as follows:

```python
from src.stochastic_models import simulate_gbm
from src.evaluation import backtest_alpha

# Simulate a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process
simulated_data = simulate_gbm(params={'mu': 0.05, 'sigma': 0.2}, steps=1000)

# Run backtest on the alpha factor
results = backtest_alpha(alpha_factor, simulated_data)

# Evaluate the performance
from src.evaluation import evaluate_performance
performance = evaluate_performance(results)
print(performance)
```
